/// Related callbacks: When the H.265 encoding is automatically downgraded to the H.264 encoding strategy, the [onPublisherVideoEncoderChanged] callback will be triggered when the encoding method changes.
/// Caution: When downgrading from H.265 to H.264 encoding occurs during the streaming process, if you are recording local video or cloud recording, multiple recording files will be generated, which needs to be dealt with.
